"# Corner-Grocer"

// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

    This program opens and reads a file "inventory.txt", it has many grocery items repeated in this file. This program will go thru a loop that will combine the repeated items to an integer.

// What did you do particularly well?

    I did particularly well on creating pointers, and closing, clearing them.

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

    I could enhance my code by having less code in the main, providing a more organized and simple code to where it is outputed from.

// Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

    The most challenging part of this project was getting "addItem" and increasing the quantity of the item. I was having trouble because as addItem is not a const I was trying to link it with other const variables. I overcame this challenge by creating another pointer, creating another variable existingItem, grabbing the item name and increasing the item quantity in that function.

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    Skills from this project can be used in other projects or course work would include, using pointers, opening files, and creating a backup file for when the program is closed.
    
// How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable by using variables such as "mainMenu", this is where the menu options display to the user and is easier to find if anything needs to be changed. The readable part goes back to maintainable, and using proper commenting explaining what function does what, so there is a understanding of what part of the code is responsable for doing the input, output, and functions. This program is adaptable as if can be used for other things other than grocery items. For example the program and be changed into a program for surveys, collecting the data into the txt file and updating it to be more readable.
